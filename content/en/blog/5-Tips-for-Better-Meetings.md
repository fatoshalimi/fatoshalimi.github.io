Meetings. The word alone often causes groans. Why is that? How can you make the best of them? While meetings have become increasingly virtual, they remain essential in professional settings.

After organizing and attending numerous meetings, I've noticed that many aren’t impactful. Often, they’re inefficient and sometimes even unnecessary. So, how can we improve the way we conduct meetings?

### 🎯 Agenda, Preparation & Goal

A meeting needs an agenda, right? Surprisingly, that’s not always the case. As the organizer, you must establish an agenda, outline preparatory items, and set clear goals before sending out the invitation. Just a meeting title won’t cut it. Time is valuable, and attendees are giving up some of theirs. Your responsibility as the organizer is to make this time worthwhile.

To ensure a productive meeting, all participants should know the agenda items, the meeting’s objective, and any preparatory work needed.

Example (from a university project meeting):

**Agenda**:

- Updates on completed tasks
- Status on current tasks
- Plan and assign upcoming tasks

**Goal**:

- Ensure all team members are up-to-date
- Assign at least one task to each team member

**Preparation**:

- Lead prioritizes next tasks
- Team members review and present their completed tasks

### 🤔 Not Every Topic Needs a Meeting

Meetings aren’t ideal for initial brainstorming sessions. Brainstorming is best done independently, without time pressure. You can share the ideas via email or a shared document, then discuss as a group.

Status updates don’t need a meeting either. They can be shared through email, with follow-up questions handled the same way. Meetings are most effective with 3-5 people when a key decision needs multiple perspectives.

### 🕐 A 1-Hour Meeting Isn’t Just 1 Hour

Meetings have high opportunity costs. A one-hour meeting with five participants actually uses five work hours. Scheduling a meeting also means everyone must be available at a set time, which may force rescheduling other commitments. This applies to recurring meetings as well, as they lock in participants' future time. Be mindful with meetings to protect productivity and respect everyone’s time.

### ✂️ 25% Shorter Meetings

How often does a 60-minute meeting end early, yet the remaining time is used to fill the hour? Meetings don’t need to last exactly 60 minutes. Try reducing the time by 25%—schedule a 45-minute meeting instead of 60. Shortening meetings respects participants’ time and keeps the agenda tight, minimizing off-topic discussions. Your team will appreciate it.

### 📦 Treat Your Meeting Like a Product

You can’t keep doing the same thing and expect improvements. Treat your meetings like a product you’re releasing. The participants are your "customers." Get feedback. Ask if they felt the meeting was a good use of time, if the goal was met, and what could be improved. Incorporate this feedback into future meetings for continuous improvement.
