Requirements engineering aims to understand client and stakeholder needs and translate them into clear, understandable language. Throughout this process, several factors can lead to inadequate requirements.

### Defining a Stakeholder

According to the [IREB Glossary](https://www.ireb.org/en/cpre/cpre-glossary/), a stakeholder is "a person or organization that influences the requirements of a system or is affected by it."

Each time requirements are gathered, misunderstandings can happen. One side describes something; the other side interprets it differently.

### 📣 Communication

Language is one of the biggest challenges. When Person A explains something to Person B, information loss is common.

#### Steps in Verbal Communication:

- A’s Thought ➔ Words ➔ B’s Understanding ➔ Documentation

At each step, information can be lost. The process involves physical and cognitive filtering as Person A translates thoughts into words, and Person B interprets and records them.

If two parties share a similar cultural or professional background, verbal communication may be more effective. Redundancies like tone, gestures, and feedback can help verify that the message is understood correctly.

### ⏱ Time and Budget Constraints

“We need feature X.” – “When?” – “Yesterday.”

This exaggerated exchange highlights a common issue: fast-paced development often means visible results are prioritized over quality. A rush to implement a feature can backfire if the client essentially becomes a tester. During reviews, a list of bugs or missed requirements often surfaces, resulting in client dissatisfaction and developer stress—a lose-lose scenario.

The effects of requirements engineering are indirect and hard to measure. Without it, costs from errors and rework escalate, impacting the overall budget.

### 👍 Assumptions

Implicit requirements are unstated or undocumented because they seem "obvious." However, perceptions vary greatly depending on each stakeholder's expertise. 

- **Client-side stakeholders** describe the “what” based on their domain knowledge.
- **Vendor-side stakeholders** focus on the technical “how.”

Implicit requirements are risky because they are only validated at the final approval stage. The [Kano Model of Customer Satisfaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kano_model) explains the connection between achieving certain product features and customer satisfaction:

- **Basic Factors**: Expected by the user and, if absent, cause dissatisfaction.
- **Performance Factors**: Contribute to satisfaction or prevent dissatisfaction.
- **Excitement Factors**: Create high satisfaction by exceeding expectations, distinguishing the product from competitors.
