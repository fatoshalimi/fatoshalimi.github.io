After more than a year of virtual meetings and online sessions, many find these interactions more mentally draining than in-person meetings. To minimize "Zoom Fatigue," effective digital leadership skills are essential. So, what does digital leadership involve, and how can you improve?

### 🤔 Show Genuine Interest

Take an active interest in your team members. Ask thoughtful questions, listen closely, and encourage them to explain details. Give them space to showcase their progress and knowledge. Build strong relationships to foster trust and increase team morale. Think of your team members as internal clients with needs and expectations—meeting these can strengthen team dynamics and boost performance.

### 👨‍💼 Avoid Power Plays

Demonstrate leadership by action, not through hierarchy or power plays. In challenging times, stand by your team and set a positive example. Celebrate accomplishments when issues are resolved, and acknowledge hard work. Set clear availability expectations to support their work-life balance—clarity helps team performance.

### 🎯 Actively Moderate Online Meetings

Without active moderation, virtual meetings can quickly become a distraction trap. Often, cameras and mics are off while one person drones on in a monologue. This highlights poor organization that would be just as ineffective in a real-life setting.

Set an agenda for each meeting, with time limits and goals for each item, so participants understand the purpose. A clear timeline shows respect for everyone’s time. Increase engagement by keeping participants both visible and audible, and only invite people who are essential. Let them leave if their presence is no longer required.

### 👥 Demonstrate Social Skills

Social skills are vital for leaders to connect with remote team members. In virtual settings, tone and inflection become even more critical. If a team member uses sarcasm or is passively resistant, engage directly. Address the underlying issue rather than dismissing the comments.

Make it clear that you value direct communication over passive or sarcastic remarks. Establish eye contact when possible and take all comments seriously. Encourage open communication, ask if there’s anything else they’d like to discuss, and thank them for their honesty. By doing this, you build trust and create a culture of open feedback.
